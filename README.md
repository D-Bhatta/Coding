Git repository for all the programmiing practice I'm gonna do for interviews ans stuff

Each subtopic should have a directory
    Each Program within the directory should have a directory
    The directory name should be the date, followed by the name of the program: <date>_<name_of_the_program>.<extension>

Commits:
    First commit should init the program with file name: "Create file for <name_of_the_program> as <date>_<name_of_the_program>.<extension>"
    When program is written , test it and then commit : "Test <name_of_the_program> and finalize it"
