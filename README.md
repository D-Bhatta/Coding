## Git repository for all the programmiing practice I'm gonna do for interviews ans stuff

Each subtopic should have a directory  
    Each Program within the directory should have a directory

    The directory name should be the date, followed by the name of the program: <date>_<name_of_the_program> 

    The file name should be the date, followed by the name of the program, followed by the extension: <date>_<name_of_the_program>.<extension>

Commits:

    Commits should be short and of the form:
    "Created programs for <program_name> <link_to_webpage>"

Comment extenssively

Remote: [Coding](https://github.com/D-Bhatta/Coding.git)

Previous commit style:

    First commit should init the program with file name: "Create file for <name_of_the_program> as <date>_<name_of_the_program>.<extension>"
    When program is written , test it and then commit : "Test <name_of_the_program> and finalize it"
This was modified to optimize workflow
